Clarifai Node.js Demo
========

A simple demo to showcase Clarifai's image recognition capabilities in Node.js

If you build your own image recognition powered magical web app or bot from this code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com. I'd love to have a look!

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I also write all about emerging tech over at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (http://www.devdiner.com), if emerging tech is your thing â€” check it out!
